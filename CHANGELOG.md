# Changelog

Notable changes to nukadoko. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
with one caveat stated in the README: this is pre-0.1, so the public API can
change without a major bump until 0.1.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-08-03

First published version. Covered by 523 tests.

### Typed steps

- `defineStep` with zod schemas for `args` and `returns`, validated at the
  run boundary, and named capture (`{name:string}`) so reordering two
  same-typed values in a pattern cannot silently swap them.
- `ctx.resultOf(step)` reads a previous step's validated result by the Step
  object's identity rather than by name, which makes the dependency a static
  import as well as a receipt entry.
- `mutates` is declared per step and checked against what the run observed:
  a Then-position step that writes fails on the measurement, not on the
  declaration.

### Receipts

- Every execution writes a receipt: the validated result, the network reads
  and writes the tool itself observed, evidence, environment, and target
  version.
- `nuka accept` freezes one green run as a committed record beside its
  feature. Execution and sign-off stay separate commands; failing runs are
  not recorded.

### Running

- `nuka init`, `scaffold`, `steps`, `describe`, `do`, `check`, `run`,
  `accept`, `session`, and `skill path`. Every command has a `--json` form
  or machine-readable output where it makes sense.
- `nuka check` reports duplicate patterns, ambiguous steps, undefined steps,
  and bare `{string}` captures before anything runs.
- Sessions, environments (`--env`), and secrets loaded from configured env
  files.

### Compat

- `nukadoko/compat` runs an existing cucumber-js suite by switching one
  import, keeping pattern syntax, hooks, and the World working while
  receipts are measured underneath. Switching the import back returns a
  plain cucumber-js suite.
- ESM only: `require("nukadoko/compat")` fails outright, so a CommonJS suite
  needs a module-format change first.

### Reports

- Allure emitter, filling the report from receipts with no per-project hook
  wiring, including the validated per-step result that classic Cucumber
  discards.
- cucumber-messages (NDJSON) emitter, so existing formatters and JUnit-based
  CI keep working.

### Skills

- Two skills following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):
  `acceptance` (a ticket's criteria through to a committed record) and
  `migration` (moving a cucumber-js suite across in two stages). Neither
  writes down what the CLI can answer.

### Not in this release

Compat gap detection in `nuka check`, an AI-assisted glue converter, and
scenario harvesting. See the [roadmap](docs/spec.md#roadmap).
